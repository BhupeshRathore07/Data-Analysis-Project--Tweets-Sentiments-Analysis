# IPL-Tweets-Sentiments-Analysis-Jio-Cinema-App

> On 31st March 2023, IPL 2023 started streaming on the Jio Cinema app for the first time ever, and it was trending on Twitter under the hashtag #jiocinema. As an emerging data scientist, I conducted a sentiment analysis of the tweets related to #jiocinema to understand the overall sentiment of the users.

> Initially, I expected to see a lot of negative tweets due to app buffering and crashing issues, but the results of the sentiment analysis were surprising. Out of the total tweets analyzed, 52.1% were neutral, 30.7% were positive, and only 17.2% were negative tweets. This indicates that the overall sentiment of the users was not as negative as I initially thought.

> Further analysis of the data revealed that the positive sentiment was mainly due to the return of MS Dhoni after a long time and the fact that IPL was happening after a long gap. The users were excited to see their favorite cricketer back in action, and this reflected in their tweets.

> Another positive aspect was the availability of commentary in multiple languages, including Bhojpuri. The tweets related to Bhojpuri commentary were particularly hilarious, and this added to the overall positive sentiment.

> It is important to note that this sentiment analysis is based on the tweets from 31st March to 1st April noon only. The sentiment might change as the tournament progresses, and it would be interesting to conduct a sentiment analysis of the overall tournament to see how the sentiment evolves over time.

> In conclusion, the sentiment analysis of #jiocinema tweets related to IPL 2023 revealed that the overall sentiment was not as negative as initially expected, and the positive sentiment was mainly due to the return of MS Dhoni and the availability of commentary in multiple languages.
